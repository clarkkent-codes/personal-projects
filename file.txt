Common causes behind this specific failure

You’re launching the script from an IDE/terminal whose working directory is different from the script’s folder.

The file name isn’t an exact match: even a small difference (uppercase/lowercase, an extra space, or a hidden second “.txt”) makes it a different file.

On Windows, “Hide extensions for known file types” can make a file that looks like “hugss.txt” actually be “hugss.txt.txt”.
